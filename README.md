# visualEyes
CSE 583 project working on a Python package to do quality control on eye tracking data while running experiments. 
This is a work in process!

# Project Description
Eye fixation directly impacts data quality in psychophysics and MRI experiments, making it a critical variable for vision scientists to control. Currently, most data quality inspections happen after the experiments, often leading to the exclusion of low-quality data. If fixation could be monitored in real time during the experiment, researchers could enhance data quality by communicating directly with participants. However, a user-friendly toolbox for this purpose is currently lacking. In this project, we aim to develop a Python package that provides clear and intuitive visualizations of eye-tracking data, helping both researchers and participants better understand and improve the quality of data being collected.
