Jane is a vision scientist. Jane wants to inspect the data quality of her psychophysics experiments by checking if participants were fixating their gaze at a specific spot on the screen. Jane needs to be able to inspect the data quickly between sessions, so that she can communicate with participants to improve data quality in the following sessions. Jane has basic understanding of Python, but she doesn't know much about the specific data format (edf) that the eye-tracker outputs, so it's important that the software handles that data format for her.
