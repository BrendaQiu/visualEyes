A research scientist is interested in combining eye tracking and EEG or other neurophysiological recording equipment since blink and eye movements (microsaccades) can have a profound impact on the EEG signal. Another benefit is that live gaze data can be used to control stimulus presentation, such that stimuli are only presented when participants are fixating a central target. Fixation onsets can also be used to define epochs in the EEG data for subsequent ERP detection. During the pre-recording trial runs, the research scientist has to know whether there are abnormal viewing behavior to better guide the participant or to adjust the visual stimulus presentation. The research scientist is familiar with EDF format, MATLAB, command line, and jupyter notebook.
