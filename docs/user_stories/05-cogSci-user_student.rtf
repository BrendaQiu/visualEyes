\f0\fs24 \cf0 User is a cognitive psychology student who is interested in gaze movemebts in relation to different auditory stimuli. The student has already collected data, so they cannot use the quality control package to re-instruct the participants if they are not following instructions. However, the student needs 'anchor' fixations to see displacement in gaze movement. To do this, they had displayed a dot on the screen that disappears when right before the stimuli is played. The student will check for each trial, whether the participants indeed had their eyes on the dot so that they can infer changes in gaze coordinates in a meaningful way. This student will look at the last 200 ms of the dot display to filter out trials that would serve her purpose, before continuing further analysis. }
