The user is a researcher who is just starting to learn about large, collaborative science. They want to explore the publicly available data from the ManyBabies consortium. They want to do some basic gaze plotting to explore how data from different labs may work (e.g., how do we look at data collected using different sized screens). They have some Python and data analysis experience, so they will use this package to parse through different files and get a sense of what variability across different labs looks like.
