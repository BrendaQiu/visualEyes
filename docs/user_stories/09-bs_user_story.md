User is a researcher who explores preferences for different social agents in infancy in childhood. The want to use the tool to explore whether 6-month-old and 12-month-old infants look differently to stimuli depicting pro-social and anti-social agents. Because infants at both age groups tend to look at non-stimuli areas quite often, and because 6-month-infants show overall shorter looking times to target stimuli, they want to extract the data for which the infants are looking at the target stimuli and calculate proportions from there. They are somewhere between a beginner and intermediate user of Python, so this package will allow them to define their areas of interest, set epochs of intererst, and find the data that is relevant to their purposes.
