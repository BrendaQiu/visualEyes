| 01 | bq | Vision Scientist | Quality control using gaze data | Quick inspection during the experiment, between sessions | Basic Python |
| 02 | mh | Researcher in CHN | Check if people were paying attention during the scan | Quick inspection between scans | Minimal command line skills but can follow instructions |
| 03 | bs | Developmental Research Scientist | Detect outlier looking behavior among infants | Ability to define areas of interest (AOI) for a specific task and perform quality control based on looking behavior around the AOI | Varied |
| 04 | lz | EEG Research Scientist | (1) Rule out the effects of blinking and microsaccades (small eye movements) from EEG data; (2) Present stimulus only when the participant fixates | Extract data on blinks and microsaccades; extract fixation data in real time | MATLAB, command line, Jupyter Notebook |
| 05 | bs | Cognitive Psychologist | Understand gaze movements in relation to different auditory stimuli | Post-hoc data quality inspection; exclude participants if they fail to fixate at a certain location during a specific time window | Ability to create specific epochs for gaze data and visualize results in batches | Varied |
| 06 | bs | Researcher using ManyBabies consortium (big, collaborative dataset) | Understand how discrepancies in data collection between labs (e.g., screen sizes) might impact the resulting data | Ability to read external datasets and visualize data collected from different settings in a meaningful way | Some Python and data analysis experience |
| 07 | bs | First-Year Graduate Researcher | Post-hoc quality control | Detailed documentation on quality control of eye-tracking data (e.g., what parameters matter, how to define those parameters, etc.) | Minimal Python |
| 08 | bs | Cognitive Psychologist | Post-hoc visual comparison| Visual comparison of two groups in their ability to maintain fixations in a an area of interest | Intermediate Python |
| 09 | bs | Developmental Cognitive Psychologist | Post-hoc quality control | Define proportion of looking time across two different age groups with varied attentional abiliites | Intermediate Python |
